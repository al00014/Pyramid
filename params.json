{"name":"Pyramid","tagline":"draws populations pyramid, wrapper to barplot()","body":"###\r\nPyramid\r\n=======\r\n\r\n```Pyramid()``` draws a population pyramid. Tons of optional arguments. Other related functions may be added. Soon to undergo overhaul.\r\n\r\nOther supplementary plotting functions, or functions related to age structure are also included. For instance, ```MyersI()```, measures the degree of apparent age-heaping in a population. ```PyramidOutline()``` adds the outline of a Pyramid to a plot (no center line), and ```aggN()``` aggregates a vector of single-age data to N-year age-groups.\r\n\r\nInstallation\r\n============\r\nTo download and install the development version of Pyramid:\r\n\r\nDownload the [zip ball](https://github.com/timriffe/Pyramid/master) or\r\n[tar ball](https://github.com/timriffe/Pyramid/tarball/master), decompress and run `R CMD INSTALL` on it in the terminal command line, or use the **devtools** package to install the development version:\r\n\r\n```r\r\n# install.packages(\"devtools\")\r\nlibrary(devtools)\r\ninstall_github(\"Pyramid\",\"timriffe\",subdir=\"Pyramid\")\r\n```\r\n\r\n**Note**: Windows users need [Rtools](http://www.murdoch-sutherland.com/Rtools/) and [devtools](http://CRAN.R-project.org/package=devtools) to install this way.\r\n\r\n**Note**: Mac users might be required to install the appropriate version [XTools](https://developer.apple.com/xcode/) from the [Apple Developer site](https://developer.apple.com/) in order to install the development version.  You may need to [register as an Apple developer](https://developer.apple.com/programs/register/).  An older version of XTools may also be required.\r\n\r\nHelp\r\n===============\r\nAll functions are documented in the standard way, which means that once you load the package using ```library(Pyramid)``` you can just type for example ```?Pyramid``` to see the help file. Help files will also soon be available on this site in html format. \r\n\r\nTo report a bug\r\n===============\r\nJust go to the [main repository page](https://github.com/timriffe/Pyramid) and click on the ```Issues``` \r\nbutton on the right side. That's a convenient way to track bugs. Otherwise, just email the maintainer. Feature requests can also be made to the maintainer. Motivated individuals are also free to offer assistance by collaborating via the ```git``` version control system and github.\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
