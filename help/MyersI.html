<h2>Calculate Myers' blended index for age heaping based on digit preference.</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>Calculate Myers' blended index for age heaping based on
digit preference. Implemented as described in Shyrock et.
al. (1980).
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  MyersI(x, ages)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of age-specific population counts</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ages</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of completed ages.</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Details</h3>

<p>Large numbers mean more bias in digit preference. Numbers
less than 1 can be disregarded. Interpret as percent of
population that would need to be moved to a different age
category for there to be no noticeable pattern of
preference in age declaration.
</p>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>the blended index value is returned.
</p>


<h3>Note</h3>

<p>This implementation will only work for digits 0-9: not
months, zodiacs or anything else that doesn't have a
period of 10
