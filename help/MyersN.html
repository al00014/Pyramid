<h2>MyersN a Myers-like index for periods of a given length</h2>

<h3>Description</h3>

<p>This function returns the same answer as <code>MyersI()</code>
under the default settings. If you're looking at
month-preference, or some other range where heaping is
possible (e.g., Fire-Horse), then change the period
accordingly. One can toggle <code>standardize</code> to change
the interpretation of the result. <code>standardize =
  FALSE</code> gives the interpretation as Myers meant it: what
percentage would need to move to another digit in order
to make the digit distribution uniform? <code>standardize
  = TRUE</code> gives the interpretation: how does this digit
distribution compare to its maximum value given the
interval steps implied by its period? See examples for
clarification on that.
</p>


<h3>Usage</h3>

<pre>
  MyersN(x, ages = 0:(length(x) - 1), period = 10,
    standardize = FALSE)
</pre>


<h3>Arguments</h3>

<table summary="R argblock">
<tr valign="top"><td><code>x</code></td>
<td>
<p>vector of population counts (age-classified
observations in general).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>ages</code></td>
<td>
<p>integer vector of the ordered classifying
variable. If not specified, this is assumed to count up
in single integers starting from 0 along the length of
<code>x</code>.</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>period</code></td>
<td>
<p>digit period. In the most common case of
age-heaping, digit preference is on 0 and 5, and so the
period is 10 (but you could compare with 5 here).</p>
</td></tr>
<tr valign="top"><td><code>standardize</code></td>
<td>
<p>logical. Does the max value equal the
percent that would need to shift for uniformity
(<code>FALSE</code>) or the percent degree of approximation to
perfect concentration for the given degree of
discreteness(<code>TRUE</code>)?</p>
</td></tr>
</table>


<h3>Value</h3>

<p>The index value, ranging from 0 to 100 (a percent).
</p>


<h3>Examples</h3>

<pre>
#' library(Pyramid)
data(PTpop)
MyersI(rowSums(PTpop[,1:2]))
MyersN(rowSums(PTpop[,1:2]))
MyersN(rowSums(PTpop[,1:2]), period = 5) # we conclude that
MyersN(rowSums(PTpop[,1:2]), period = 5, standardize = TRUE)
MyersN(rowSums(PTpop[,1:2]), period = 10, standardize = TRUE)
# we conclude that heaping is more on 0 than on 5

# full uniformity: makes no difference whether you standardize:
MyersN(rep(1, 100), period = 15, standardize = TRUE)
MyersN(rep(1, 100), period = 15, standardize = FALSE)

# absolute concentration.
# standardize = TRUE will give 100 if it can't be any more concentrated
# standardize = FALSE could only give 100 in the limit, i.e. in all
#              values are in a single digit, and the age interval is 1/Inf
MyersN(x=rep(c(1,0,0,0),30),period=4, standardize = TRUE)  # how concentrated is it relative to the theoretical max?
MyersN(x=rep(c(1,0,0,0),30),period=4, standardize = FALSE) # what prop would need to move for uniformity
</pre>
